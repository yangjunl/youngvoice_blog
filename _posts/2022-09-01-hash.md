# Problems
dictionary (key, value) pairs problem.
storing employee records with phone numbers(as keys).

# what solution?
Direct Access Table
items are stored in an array, indexed by key(random access)

larger key range $\Longrightarrow$ bigger array

do all operations in O(1) time



try 1
prehash keys to integers
interpreting keys as natural numbers

try 2
Reduce universe $u$ of all keys (say, integers) down to reasonable size $m$ for table, $m\approx n = \#keys$


hash function h: $u \longrightarrow \{0, 1, \dots , m - 1\}$

collision: if $k_i, k_j \in K \text{ and } k_i \neq k_j$ we have  $h(k_i) = h(k_j)$ it's a collision.
$K$ is the set actually stored. 

## special note
***When the number of keys actually stored is small relative to the total number of possible keys, hash tables become an effective alternative to directly addressing an array, since a hash table typically uses an array of size proportional to the number of keys actually stored.***

$K \subseteq u\Longleftrightarrow$  table doubling 
$K$ is the set actually stored. 



# Why to use Hashing?



Try solutions:
***Array***
***Linked List***

search in a linear fashion
if sorted:
searched in O(Logn) time
insert and delete operations become costly as we have to maintain sorted order


***Balanced binary search tree***

search, insert and delete in O(Logn) time


Now there might be a situation when our applications want to do the same operations in a faster way i.e. in a more optimized way and here hashing comes into play


***hash storing and retrieving data as fast as possible***
get O(1) search time on average
O(n) in worst case


It is important to understand that ***the worst case time complexity for hashing remains O(n) but the average case time complexity is O(1).***

# What operation is the basic operations?

insert(item)
delete(item)
search(item)


# What is the key components in Hash algorithm?

Hash Table 
Hash function
collision handling


# How do we deal with collisions?
Because $|U| > m$, however, there must be at least two keys that have the same hash value; avoiding collisions altogether is therefore impossible.

两个解决的方向：
direction 1. a well-designed "random"-looking hash function can minimize the number of collisions
direction 2. a method for resolving the collisions that do occur.


冲突是不可避免的，所以一定要找到一种解决冲突的方法。
method 1. Chaining
method 2. Open addressing


# what is load factor?
simple uniform hashing: An assumption, Each key is equally likely to be hashed to any slot of table, independent of where other keys are hashed.

let n = # keys stored in table
m = # slots in table
load factor $\alpha = n/m$ 
= expected # keys per slot 
= expected length of a chain.


# What hash function can used in Chaining?
什么样的 hash function 它是不好的？

a good hash function satisfies the assumption of simple uniform hashing.



在编译器中，如果我们以程序中的变量名作为 key 来存储符号信息，那么会发现，一个程序中往往会出现非常相像的变量名，所以与字母相关的hash函数可能不是很好。
这说明，我们的应用场景下 key 的选择并不是随机在 $U$ 空间采样的
也就是在具体应用中可能会出现采样的数据 pattern 模式，如果不在 hash 函数中处理这种情况，那会将数据 hash 到某几个 slots 中，这样会降低算法性能。


A good approach derives the hash value in a way that we expect to be independent of any patterns that might exist in the data.
我的思考：
我们尽量让 hash value 与数据模式无关，是为了防止某个场景下数据出现 pattern 使得 hash 算法性能降低。
能不能利用数据中的 pattern 让 hash 性能较好？？？（也就是在具体应用中会出现采样数据的固定pattern）



note:
可以借此考察一下项目中的 hash function 设计的怎么样？



stronger properties, key close, hash values far apart, linear probing, universal hashing.

## The division method
how to choose the value of m????
如果选了 2 的次幂会出现什么问题？


# What complexity of search in Chaining?
search must go through whole list T[h(key)]
worst case: all n keys hash to same slot $\Longrightarrow \
\Theta(n)$ per operation(退化成链表)

expected running time for search is $\Theta(1+\alpha)$


case 1: the search is unsuccessful
case 2: the search is successful
# How to prove the average-case time complexicity that a successful search will takes in a hash table in which collisions are resolved by chaining, under the assumption of simple uniform hashing? 




# summary
hash table is a generalization of array
